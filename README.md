BERT Attention Visualization Project
A complete guide to build, visualize, and deploy BERT attention mechanisms using BERTviz and Streamlit.

📋 Project Overview
This project visualizes how BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) pays attention to different tokens in a sentence. Think of it as an X-ray for neural networks!
